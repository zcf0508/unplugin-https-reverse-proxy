log\_skip
=========

Skips access logging for matched requests.

This should be used alongside the [`log` directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/log) to skip logging requests that are not relevant for your needs.

Prior to v2.8.0, this directive was named `skip_log`, but was renamed for consistency with other directives.

Syntax
------

```
log_skip [<matcher>]
```

Examples
--------

Skip access logging for static files stored in a subpath:

```
example.com {
	root * /srv

	log
	log_skip /static*

	file_server
}
```

Skip access logging for requests matching a pattern; in this case, for files with particular extensions:

```
@skip path_regexp \.(js|css|png|jpe?g|gif|ico|woff|otf|ttf|eot|svg|txt|pdf|docx?|xlsx?)$
log_skip @skip
```

The matcher is not needed if it's found within a route which is already within a matcher. For example with a handle for a file server for a particular subpath:

```
handle_path /static* {
	root * /srv/static
	log_skip
	file_server
}
```
