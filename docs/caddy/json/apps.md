---------------------------------------------------------------------------

AppsRaw are the apps that Caddy will load and run. The app module name is the key, and the app's config is the associated value.

ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.
