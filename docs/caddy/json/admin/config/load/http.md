---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTPLoader can load Caddy configs over HTTP(S).

If the response is not a JSON config, a config adapter must be specified either in the loader config (`adapter`), or in the Content-Type HTTP header returned in the HTTP response from the server. The Content-Type header is read just like the admin API's `/load` endpoint. If you don't have control over the HTTP server (but can still trust its response), you can override the Content-Type header by setting the `adapter` property in this config.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/#module)[module](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/module/)
This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/#method)[method](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/method/)
The method for the request. Default: GET

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/#url)[url](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/url/)
The URL of the request.

HTTP headers to add to the request.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/#timeout)[timeout](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/timeout/)
Maximum time allowed for a complete connection and request.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/#adapter)[adapter](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/config/load/http/adapter/)
The name of the config adapter to use, if any. Only needed if the HTTP response is not a JSON config and if the server's Content-Type header is missing or incorrect.
