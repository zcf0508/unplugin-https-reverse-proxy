-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options pertaining to remote administration. By default, remote administration is disabled. If enabled, identity management must also be configured, as that is how the endpoint is secured. See the neighboring "identity" object.

EXPERIMENTAL: This feature is subject to change.

RemoteAdmin enables and configures remote administration. If enabled, a secure listener enforcing mutual TLS authentication will be started on a different port from the standard plaintext admin server.

This endpoint is secured using identity management, which must be configured separately (because identity management does not depend on remote administration). See the admin/identity config struct.

EXPERIMENTAL: Subject to change.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#listen)[listen](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/listen/)
The address on which to start the secure listener. Default: :2021

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#access_control)[access_control](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/access_control/)
List of access controls for this secure admin endpoint. This configures TLS mutual authentication (i.e. authorized client certificates), but also application-layer permissions like which paths and methods each identity is authorized for.

AdminAccess specifies what permissions an identity or group of identities are granted.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#access_control/public_keys)[access_control/public_keys](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/access_control/public_keys/)
Base64-encoded DER certificates containing public keys to accept. (The contents of PEM certificate blocks are base64-encoded DER.) Any of these public keys can appear in any part of a verified chain.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#access_control/permissions)[access_control/permissions](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/access_control/permissions/)
Limits what the associated identities are allowed to do. If unspecified, all permissions are granted.

AdminPermissions specifies what kinds of requests are allowed to be made to the admin endpoint.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#access_control/permissions/paths)[access_control/permissions/paths](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/access_control/permissions/paths/)
The API paths allowed. Paths are simple prefix matches. Any subpath of the specified paths will be allowed.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/#access_control/permissions/methods)[access_control/permissions/methods](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/admin/remote/access_control/permissions/methods/)
The HTTP methods allowed for the given paths.
