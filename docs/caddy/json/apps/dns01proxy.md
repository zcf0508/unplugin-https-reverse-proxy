[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#dns/ttl)[dns/ttl](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/dns/ttl/)
The TTL to use in DNS TXT records when answering challenges. Optional. Not usually needed.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#dns/resolvers)[dns/resolvers](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/dns/resolvers/)
Custom DNS resolvers to prefer over system or built-in defaults. Set this to a public resolver if you are using split-horizon DNS.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#accounts)[accounts](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/accounts/)
Configures HTTP basic authentication and the domains for which each user can get TLS certificates.

(During provisioning, this is used to fill in [Authentication] and [ClientRegistry].)

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#accounts/user_id)[accounts/user_id](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/accounts/user_id/)
Identifies the client to which this policy applies.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#accounts/allow_domains)[accounts/allow_domains](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/accounts/allow_domains/)
Determines the domains for which the user can get TLS certificates. This largely follows Smallstep's domain name rules: [https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/policies/#domain-names](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/policies/#domain-names)

Due to a limitation in ACME and DNS-01, allowing a domain alsow allows wildcard certificates for that domain.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#accounts/deny_domains)[accounts/deny_domains](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/accounts/deny_domains/)
There are no docs for this property.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#accounts/password)[accounts/password](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/accounts/password/)
The user's password, hashed using `caddy hash-password`. Optional. If omitted, then clients must be authenticated by an `http.handlers.authentication` instance earlier in the handler chain.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#hostnames)[hostnames](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/hostnames/)
The server's hostnames. Used for obtaining TLS certificates.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#listen)[listen](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/listen/)
The sockets on which to listen. For example, "127.0.0.1:9095" or ":443".

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/#trusted_proxies)[trusted_proxies](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dns01proxy/trusted_proxies/)
Configures the set of trusted proxies, for accurate logging of client IP addresses.
