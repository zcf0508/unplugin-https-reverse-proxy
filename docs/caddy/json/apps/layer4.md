Non-standard**This module does not come with Caddy.** It can be added by using **[xcaddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/build#xcaddy)** or our **[download page](https://caddyserver.com/download)**. Non-standard modules may be developed by the community and are not officially endorsed or maintained by the Caddy project. The documentation is shown here only as a courtesy.

Description[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/#docs "Direct link")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

App is a Caddy app that operates closest to layer 4 of the OSI model.

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/#servers)[servers](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/servers/)
Server represents a Caddy layer4 server.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/#servers/listen)[servers/listen](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/servers/listen/)
There are no docs for this property.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/#servers/routes)[servers/routes](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/servers/routes/)
Route represents a collection of handlers that are gated by matching and other kinds of logic.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/#servers/routes/match)[servers/routes/match](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/layer4/servers/routes/match/)
ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.
