SSH is the app providing ssh services

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/#grace_period)[grace_period](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/grace_period/)
GracePeriod is the duration a server should wait for open connections to close during shutdown before closing them forcefully

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/#servers)[servers](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/servers/)
The set of ssh servers keyed by custom names

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/#servers/address)[servers/address](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/servers/address/)
Socket addresses to which to bind listeners. Accepts [network addresses](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#network-addresses) that may include port ranges. Listener addresses must be unique; they cannot be repeated across all defined servers. TCP is the only acceptable network (for now, perhaps).

connection timeout when no activity, none if empty

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/#servers/max_timeout)[servers/max_timeout](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/ssh/servers/max_timeout/)

The list of defined subsystems in a json structure keyed by the arbitrary name of the subsystem. TODO: The current implementation is naive and can be expanded to follow the Authorzation and Actors model

ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.

ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.
