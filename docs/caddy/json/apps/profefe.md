Description[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/#docs "Direct link")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `profefe` app collects profiling data during the life-time of the process and uploads them to the profefe server.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/#address)[address](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/address/)
The URL of the Profefe service. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/#service)[service](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/service/)
The service name reported to Profefe. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/#timeout)[timeout](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/timeout/)
The timeout for the upload call. Setting the value to `0` disables the timeout and the call waits indefinitely until the upload is finished.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/#parameters)[parameters](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/profefe/parameters/)
The profiling parameters to be reported to Profefe. The paramters cpu_profile_rate, block_profile_rate, and mutex_profile_fraction are inherited from the `profiling` app if `profefe` is configured as a child module. The `profile_types` field is inherited if not configured explicitly. If `profefe` is configured as an app, all the parameters are instated as-is.
