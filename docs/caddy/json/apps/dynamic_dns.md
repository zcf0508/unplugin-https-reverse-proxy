[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/#domains)[domains](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/domains/)
The record names, keyed by DNS zone, for which to update the A/AAAA records. Record names are relative to the zone. The zone is usually your registered domain name. To refer to the zone itself, use the record name of "@".

For example, assuming your zone is example.com, and you want to update A/AAAA records for "example.com" and "[www.example.com"](http://www.example.com"/) so that they resolve to this Caddy instance, configure like so: `"example.com": ["@", "www"]`

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/#dynamic_domains)[dynamic_domains](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/dynamic_domains/)
If enabled, the "http" app's config will be scanned to assemble the list of domains for which to enable dynamic DNS updates.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/#versions)[versions](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/versions/)
The IP versions to enable. By default, both "ipv4" and "ipv6" will be enabled. To disable IPv6, specify {"ipv6": false}.

IPVersions is the IP versions to enable for dynamic DNS. Versions are enabled if true or nil, set to false to disable.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/#check_interval)[check_interval](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/check_interval/)
How frequently to check the public IP address. Default: 30m

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/#ttl)[ttl](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/dynamic_dns/ttl/)
The TTL to set on DNS records.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.
