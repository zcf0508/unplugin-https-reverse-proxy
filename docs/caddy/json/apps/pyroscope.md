-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `pyroscope` app collects profiling data during the life-time of the process and uploads them to the Pyroscope server.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#application_name)[application_name](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/application_name/)
The application name reported to Pyroscope. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#server_address)[server_address](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/server_address/)
The URL of the Pyroscope service. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#auth_token)[auth_token](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/auth_token/)
The token for Pyroscope Cloud. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#basic_auth_user)[basic_auth_user](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/basic_auth_user/)
The Basic Auth username of the Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#basic_auth_password)[basic_auth_password](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/basic_auth_password/)
The Basic Auth of the Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#tenant_id)[tenant_id](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/tenant_id/)
The tenant ID to support the case of multi-tenant Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#disable_gc_runs)[disable_gc_runs](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/disable_gc_runs/)
Disable automatic runtime.GC runs between getting the heap profiles

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#upload_rate)[upload_rate](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/upload_rate/)
The frequency of upload to the Phlare server

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/#parameters)[parameters](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/pyroscope/parameters/)
The profiling parameters to be reported to Pyroscope. The paramters cpu_profile_rate, block_profile_rate, and mutex_profile_fraction are inherited from the `profiling` app if `pyroscope` is configured as a child module. The `profile_types` field is inherited if not configured explicitly. If `pyroscope` is configured as an app, all the parameters are instated as-is. Note: Pyroscope agent does not support `threadcreate` profile type, hence ignored.
