-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.log_append implements a middleware that takes a key and value, where the key is the name of a log field and the value is a placeholder, or variable key, or constant value to use for that field.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.log_append#key)key
Key is the name of the log field.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.log_append#value)value
Value is the value to use for the log field. If it is a placeholder (with surrounding `{}`), it will be evaluated when the log is written. If the value is a key that exists in the `vars` map, the value of that key will be used. Otherwise the value will be used as-is as a constant string.
