admin.api.metrics is a module that serves a metrics endpoint so that any gathered metrics can be exposed for scraping. This module is not configurable, and is permanently mounted to the admin API endpoint at "/metrics". See the Metrics module for a configurable endpoint that is usable if the Admin API is disabled.
