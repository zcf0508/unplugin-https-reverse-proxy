--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.gopkg implements vanity go package import paths.

Vanity go package import paths give a cleaner appearance to go projects by separating the source code location from the import path. It also gives flexibility to developers by allowing them to change a project's source code hosting platform without requiring the project to be renamed. Finally, it allows projects hosted on various platforms to be grouped under a common import path.

Field List
----------

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.gopkg#path)path
Path is the HTTP path component of the vanity import path.

Given a vanity import path of `web.site/package/name`, the path would be `/package/name`.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.gopkg#vcs)vcs
Vcs is the version control system used by the package.

If empty, the default is `git`. Valid values include `git`, `hg`, `svn`, `bzr`, `cvs`. Basically, any version control system that go knows how to address.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.gopkg#url)url
URL is the URL of the package's source.

This is where the go tool will go to download the source code.
