The root directory out of which to serve files. If not specified, `{http.vars.root}` will be used if set; otherwise, the current directory is assumed. Accepts placeholders.

Should be used if one more more matchers are used with the webdav directive and it's needed to let the webdav share know what the request base path will be.
