http.handlers.replace_response manipulates response bodies by performing substring or regex replacements.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.replace_response#replacements)replacements
The list of replacements to make on the response body.

Replacement is either a substring or regular expression replacement to perform; precisely one must be specified, not both.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.replace_response#replacements/search)replacements/search
A substring to search for. Mutually exclusive with search_regexp.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.replace_response#replacements/search_regexp)replacements/search_regexp
A regular expression to search for. Mutually exclusive with search.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.replace_response#replacements/replace)replacements/replace
The replacement string/value. Required.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.replace_response#stream)stream
If true, perform replacements in a streaming fashion. This is more memory-efficient but can remove the Content-Length header since knowing the correct length is impossible without buffering, and getting it wrong can break HTTP/2 streams.
