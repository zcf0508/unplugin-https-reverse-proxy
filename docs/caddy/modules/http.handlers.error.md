http.handlers.error implements a simple handler that returns an error. This handler returns an error value, but does not write a response. This is useful when you want the server to act as if an error occurred; for example, to invoke your custom error handling logic.

Since this handler does not write a response, the error information is for use by the server to know how to handle the error.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.error#error)error
The error message. Optional. Default is no error message.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.error#status_code)status_code
The recommended HTTP status code. Can be either an integer or a string if placeholders are needed. Optional. Default is 500.

WeakString is a type that unmarshals any JSON value as a string literal, with the following exceptions:

1.   actual string values are decoded as strings; and
2.   null is decoded as empty string;

and provides methods for getting the value as various primitive types. However, using this type removes any type safety as far as deserializing JSON is concerned.
