http.matchers.tls matches HTTP requests based on the underlying TLS connection state. If this matcher is specified but the request did not come over TLS, it will never match. If this matcher is specified but is empty and the request did come in over TLS, it will always match.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.tls#handshake_complete)handshake_complete
Matches if the TLS handshake has completed. QUIC 0-RTT early data may arrive before the handshake completes. Generally, it is unsafe to replay these requests if they are not idempotent; additionally, the remote IP of early data packets can more easily be spoofed. It is conventional to respond with HTTP 425 Too Early if the request cannot risk being processed in this state.
