http.matchers.not matches requests by negating the results of its matcher sets. A single "not" matcher takes one or more matcher sets. Each matcher set is OR'ed; in other words, if any matcher set returns true, the final result of the "not" matcher is false. Individual matchers within a set work the same (i.e. different matchers in the same set are AND'ed).

NOTE: The generated docs which describe the structure of this module are wrong because of how this type unmarshals JSON in a custom way. The correct structure is:

```
[
    {},
    {}
]
```

where each of the array elements is a matcher set, i.e. an object keyed by matcher name.
