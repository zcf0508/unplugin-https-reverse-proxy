caddy.listeners.http_redirect provides HTTP->HTTPS redirects for connections that come on the TLS port as an HTTP request, by detecting using the first few bytes that it's not a TLS handshake, but instead an HTTP request.

This is especially useful when using a non-standard HTTPS port. A user may simply type the address in their browser without the https:// scheme, which would cause the browser to attempt the connection over HTTP, but this would cause a "Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server" error response.

This listener wrapper must be placed BEFORE the "tls" listener wrapper, for it to work properly.

MaxHeaderBytes is the maximum size to parse from a client's HTTP request headers. Default: 1 MB
