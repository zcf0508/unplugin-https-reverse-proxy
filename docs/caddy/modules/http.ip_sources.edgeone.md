Persistence options: by default, the plugin persists cache to disk so that ETag/Last-Modified and the last good snapshot survive restarts. If empty, defaults to a file in Caddy's app data directory.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.ip_sources.edgeone#persist_ttl)persist_ttl
Optional TTL for using persisted snapshot. If set, and the snapshot is older than this duration at startup, ranges will not be loaded from disk (validators may still be used). Default: disabled.
