The uwsgi transport module allows you to proxy requests to an uWSGI server with uwsgi protocol.

Caddyfile syntax is also supported:

```caddyfile
reverse_proxy [<matcher>] [<upstreams...>] {
      transport uwsgi {
        uwsgi_param <key> <value> # in case you need to set uwsgi params (for example UWSGI_SCRIPT)
      }
    }
```

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.transport.uwsgi#uwsgi_params)uwsgi_params
UWSGIParams is a map of static uwsgi params to be passed to uWSGI server. This is useful for example, setting UWSGI_SCRIPT (uWSGI may require this for some request) and many other params.
