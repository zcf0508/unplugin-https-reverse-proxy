http.handlers.vars is an HTTP middleware which sets variables to have values that can be used in the HTTP request handler chain. The primary way to access variables is with placeholders, which have the form: `{http.vars.variable_name}`, or with the `vars` and `vars_regexp` request matchers.

The key is the variable name, and the value is the value of the variable. Both the name and value may use or contain placeholders.
