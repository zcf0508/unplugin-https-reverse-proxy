http.handlers.copy_response is a special HTTP handler which may only be used within reverse_proxy's handle_response routes, to copy the proxy response. EXPERIMENTAL, subject to change.

To write the upstream response's body but with a different status code, set this field to the desired status code.

WeakString is a type that unmarshals any JSON value as a string literal, with the following exceptions:

1.   actual string values are decoded as strings; and
2.   null is decoded as empty string;

and provides methods for getting the value as various primitive types. However, using this type removes any type safety as far as deserializing JSON is concerned.
