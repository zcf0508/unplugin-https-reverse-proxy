Description[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#docs "Direct link")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.ipmap implements a middleware that maps IP / Subnets as inputs to outputs. Specifically, it compares a source value against the map inputs, and for one that matches, it applies the output values to each destination. Destinations become placeholder names.

Mapped placeholders are not evaluated until they are used, so even for very large mappings, this handler is quite efficient.

Field List
----------

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#source)source
Source is the placeholder from which to get the input value.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#destinations)destinations
Destinations are the names of placeholders in which to store the outputs. Destination values should be wrapped in braces, for example, {my_placeholder}.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#mappings)mappings
Mappings from IP / Subnet source values (inputs) to destination values (outputs). The first matching, non-nil mapping will be applied.

Mapping describes a mapping from input to outputs.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#mappings/input)mappings/input
The input value to match. Must be distinct from other mappings. Needs to be an IP / Subnet

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#mappings/outputs)mappings/outputs
Upon a match with the input, each output is positionally correlated with each destination of the parent handler. An output that is null (nil) will be treated as if it was not mapped at all.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.ipmap#defaults)defaults
If no mappings match or if the mapped output is null/nil, the associated default output will be applied (optional).

Fulfilled by modules in namespace:

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
