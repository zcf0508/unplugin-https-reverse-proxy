http.matchers.remote_host matches based on the remote IP of the connection. A host name can be specified, whose A and AAAA DNS records will be resolved to a corresponding IP for matching.

Note that IPs can sometimes be spoofed, so do not rely on this as a replacement for actual authentication.

If true, prefer the first IP in the request's X-Forwarded-For header, if present, rather than the immediate peer's IP, as the reference IP against which to match. Note that it is easy to spoof request headers. Default: false
