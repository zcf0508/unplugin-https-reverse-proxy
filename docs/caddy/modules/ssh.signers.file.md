[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/ssh.signers.file#keys)keys
The collection of `signer.Key` resources. Relative paths are appended to the path of the current working directory. The supported PEM types and algorithms are:

*   RSA PRIVATE KEY: RSA
*   PRIVATE KEY: RSA, ECDSA, ed25519
*   EC PRIVATE KEY: ECDSA
*   DSA PRIVATE KEY: DSA
*   OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY: RSA, ed25519, ECDSA

Key is a generic holder of the location and passphrase of key (abstract) files

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/ssh.signers.file#keys/source)keys/source
Source is the identifying path of the key depending on the source. In the case of `file` signer, `Source` refers to the path to the file on disk in relative or absolute path forms. Other signers are free to define the semantics of the field.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/ssh.signers.file#keys/passphrase)keys/passphrase
A non-empty value means the key is protected with a passphrase
