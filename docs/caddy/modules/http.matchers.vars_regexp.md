http.matchers.vars_regexp matches the value of the context variables by a given regular expression.

Upon a match, it adds placeholders to the request: `{http.regexp.name.capture_group}` where `name` is the regular expression's name, and `capture_group` is either the named or positional capture group from the expression itself. If no name is given, then the placeholder omits the name: `{http.regexp.capture_group}` (potentially leading to collisions).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.vars_regexp#name)name
A unique name for this regular expression. Optional, but useful to prevent overwriting captures from other regexp matchers.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.vars_regexp#pattern)pattern
The regular expression to evaluate, in RE2 syntax, which is the same general syntax used by Go, Perl, and Python. For details, see [Go's regexp package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/). Captures are accessible via placeholders. Unnamed capture groups are exposed as their numeric, 1-based index, while named capture groups are available by the capture group name.
