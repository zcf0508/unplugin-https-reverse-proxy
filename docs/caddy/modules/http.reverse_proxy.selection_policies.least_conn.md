http.reverse_proxy.selection_policies.least_conn is a policy that selects the host with the least active requests. If multiple hosts have the same fewest number, one is chosen randomly. The term "conn" or "connection" is used in this policy name due to its similar meaning in other software, but our load balancer actually counts active requests rather than connections, since these days requests are multiplexed onto shared connections.
