Markdown Content:
The `pyroscope` app collects profiling data during the life-time of the process and uploads them to the Pyroscope server.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#application_name)application_name
The application name reported to Pyroscope. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#server_address)server_address
The URL of the Pyroscope service. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#auth_token)auth_token
The token for Pyroscope Cloud. The config value may be a [placeholder](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#placeholders).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#basic_auth_user)basic_auth_user
The Basic Auth username of the Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#basic_auth_password)basic_auth_password
The Basic Auth of the Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#tenant_id)tenant_id
The tenant ID to support the case of multi-tenant Phlare server

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#disable_gc_runs)disable_gc_runs
Disable automatic runtime.GC runs between getting the heap profiles

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#upload_rate)upload_rate
The frequency of upload to the Phlare server

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pyroscope#parameters)parameters
The profiling parameters to be reported to Pyroscope. The paramters cpu_profile_rate, block_profile_rate, and mutex_profile_fraction are inherited from the `profiling` app if `pyroscope` is configured as a child module. The `profile_types` field is inherited if not configured explicitly. If `pyroscope` is configured as an app, all the parameters are instated as-is. Note: Pyroscope agent does not support `threadcreate` profile type, hence ignored.
