http.handlers.adobe_usage_tracker implements HTTP middleware that parses uploaded log files from Adobe desktop applications in order to collect measurements about past launches. These measurements are then uploaded to an InfluxDB (using the v1 HTTP API).

Configuration of the tracker requires four parameters:

*   the endpoint URL of the influx v1 upload api
*   the name of the influx v1 database
*   the retention policy of the influx v1 database
*   an API token authorized for writes of the database

Note: this middleware uses the v1 HTTP write API because it's fully supported by both v1 and v3 databases. When using a v3 database, you must specify a "dbrp" mapping from the database and policy names to the specific bucket you want uploads to go to. See the influx docs for details:
