------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HTTPCertPool fetches the trusted root certificates from HTTP(S) endpoints. The TLS connection properties can be customized, including custom trusted root certificate. One example usage of this module is to get the trusted certificates from another Caddy instance that is running the PKI app and ACME server.

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#endpoints)endpoints
the list of URLs that respond with PEM-encoded certificates to trust.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls)tls
Customize the TLS connection knobs to used during the HTTP call

TLSConfig holds configuration related to the TLS configuration for the transport/client. copied from with minor modifications: modules/caddyhttp/reverseproxy/httptransport.go

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls/ca)tls/ca
Provides the guest module that provides the trusted certificate authority (CA) certificates

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls/insecure_skip_verify)tls/insecure_skip_verify
If true, TLS verification of server certificates will be disabled. This is insecure and may be removed in the future. Do not use this option except in testing or local development environments.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls/handshake_timeout)tls/handshake_timeout
The duration to allow a TLS handshake to a server. Default: No timeout.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls/server_name)tls/server_name
The server name used when verifying the certificate received in the TLS handshake. By default, this will use the upstream address' host part. You only need to override this if your upstream address does not match the certificate the upstream is likely to use. For example if the upstream address is an IP address, then you would need to configure this to the hostname being served by the upstream server. Currently, this does not support placeholders because the TLS config is not provisioned on each connection, so a static value must be used.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.ca_pool.source.http#tls/renegotiation)tls/renegotiation
TLS renegotiation level. TLS renegotiation is the act of performing subsequent handshakes on a connection after the first. The level can be:

*   "never": (the default) disables renegotiation.
*   "once": allows a remote server to request renegotiation once per connection.
*   "freely": allows a remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation.

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
