-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.matchers.expression matches requests by evaluating a [CEL](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) expression. This enables complex logic to be expressed using a comfortable, familiar syntax. Please refer to [the standard definitions of CEL functions and operators](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#standard-definitions).

This matcher's JSON interface is actually a string, not a struct. The generated docs are not correct because this type has custom marshaling logic.

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: This module is still experimental and is not subject to Caddy's compatibility guarantee.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.expression#expr)expr
The CEL expression to evaluate. Any Caddy placeholders will be expanded and situated into proper CEL function calls before evaluating.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.expression#name)name
Name is an optional name for this matcher. This is used to populate the name for regexp matchers that appear in the expression.
