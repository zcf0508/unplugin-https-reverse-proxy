tls.certificates.automate will automatically manage certificates for the names in the list, including obtaining and renewing certificates. Automated certificates are managed according to their matching automation policy, configured elsewhere in this app.

Technically, this is a no-op certificate loader module that is treated as a special case: it uses this app's automation features to load certificates for the list of hostnames, rather than loading certificates manually. But the end result is the same: certificates for these subject names will be loaded into the in-memory cache and may then be used.
