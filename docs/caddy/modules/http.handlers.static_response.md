http.handlers.static_response implements a simple responder for static responses.

Field List
----------

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.static_response#status_code)status_code
The HTTP status code to respond with. Can be an integer or, if needing to use a placeholder, a string.

If the status code is 103 (Early Hints), the response headers will be written to the client immediately, the body will be ignored, and the next handler will be invoked. This behavior is EXPERIMENTAL while RFC 8297 is a draft, and may be changed or removed.

WeakString is a type that unmarshals any JSON value as a string literal, with the following exceptions:

1.   actual string values are decoded as strings; and
2.   null is decoded as empty string;

and provides methods for getting the value as various primitive types. However, using this type removes any type safety as far as deserializing JSON is concerned.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.static_response#headers)headers
Header fields to set on the response; overwrites any existing header fields of the same names after normalization.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.static_response#body)body
The response body. If non-empty, the Content-Type header may be added automatically if it is not explicitly configured nor already set on the response; the default value is "text/plain; charset=utf-8" unless the body is a valid JSON object or array, in which case the value will be "application/json". Other than those common special cases the Content-Type header should be set explicitly if it is desired because MIME sniffing is disabled for safety.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.static_response#close)close
If true, the server will close the client's connection after writing the response.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.static_response#abort)abort
Immediately and forcefully closes the connection without writing a response. Interrupts any other HTTP streams on the same connection.

Fulfilled by modules in namespace:

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
