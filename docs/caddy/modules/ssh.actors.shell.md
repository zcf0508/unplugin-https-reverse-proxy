-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ssh.actors.shell is an `ssh.actors` module providing "shell" to a session. The module spawns a process using the user's default shell, as defined in the OS. On *nix, except for macOS, the module parses `/etc/passwd`, for the details and caches the result for future logins. On macOS, the module calls `dscl . -read` for the necessary user details and caches them for future logins. On Windows, the module uses the [`os/user` package](https://pkg.go.dev/os/user?GOOS=windows) from the Go standard library.

Executes the designated command using the user's default shell, regardless of the supplied command. It follows the OpenSSH semantics specified for the [`ForceCommand`](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man5/sshd_config.5#ForceCommand) except for the part about `internal-sftp`.
