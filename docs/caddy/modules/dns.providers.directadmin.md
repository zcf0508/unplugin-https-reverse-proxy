--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dns.providers.directadmin lets Caddy read and manipulate DNS records hosted by this DNS provider.

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.directadmin#host)host
ServerURL should be the hostname (with port if necessary) of the DirectAdmin instance you are trying to use

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.directadmin#user)user
User should be the DirectAdmin username that the Login Key is created under

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.directadmin#login_key)login_key
LoginKey is used for authentication

The key will need two permissions:

`CMD_API_SHOW_DOMAINS`

`CMD_API_DNS_CONTROL`

Unless you are only using `GetRecords()`, in which case `CMD_API_DNS_CONTROL` can be omitted

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.directadmin#insecure_requests)insecure_requests
InsecureRequests is an optional parameter used to ignore SSL related errors on the DirectAdmin host

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.directadmin#debug)debug
Debug - can set this to stdout or stderr to dump debugging information about the API interaction with powerdns. This will dump your auth token in plain text so be careful.

Fulfilled by modules in namespace:

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
