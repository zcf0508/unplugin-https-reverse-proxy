admin.api.load is a module that provides the /load endpoint for the Caddy admin API. The only reason it's not baked into the caddy package directly is because of the import of the caddyconfig package for its GetAdapter function. If the caddy package depends on the caddyconfig package, then the caddyconfig package will not be able to import the caddy package, and it can more easily cause backward edges in the dependency tree (i.e. import cycle). Fortunately, the admin API has first-class support for adding endpoints from modules.
