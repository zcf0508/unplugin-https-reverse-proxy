tls.get_certificate.http can get a certificate via HTTP(S) request.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.get_certificate.http#url)url
The URL from which to download the certificate. Required.

The URL will be augmented with query string parameters taken from the TLS handshake:

*   server_name: The SNI value
*   signature_schemes: Comma-separated list of hex IDs of signatures
*   cipher_suites: Comma-separated list of hex IDs of cipher suites

To be valid, the response must be HTTP 200 with a PEM body consisting of blocks for the certificate chain and the private key.

To indicate that this manager is not managing a certificate for the described handshake, the endpoint should return HTTP 204 (No Content). Error statuses will indicate that the manager is capable of providing a certificate but was unable to.
