dns.providers.lego_deprecated is a shim module that allows any and all of the DNS providers in go-acme/lego to be used with Caddy. They must be configured via environment variables, they do not support cancellation in the case of frequent config changes.

Even though this module is in the dns.providers namespace, it is only a special case for solving ACME challenges, intended to replace the modules that used to be in the now-defunct tls.dns namespace. Using it in other places of the Caddy config will result in errors.

This module will eventually go away in favor of the modules that make use of the libdns APIs: [https://github.com/libdns](https://github.com/libdns)
