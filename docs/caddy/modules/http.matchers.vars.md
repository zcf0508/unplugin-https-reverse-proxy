http.matchers.vars is an HTTP request matcher which can match requests based on variables in the context or placeholder values. The key is the placeholder or name of the variable, and the values are possible values the variable can be in order to match (logical OR'ed).

If the key is surrounded by `{ }` it is assumed to be a placeholder. Otherwise, it will be considered a variable name.

Placeholders in the keys are not expanded, but placeholders in the values are.
