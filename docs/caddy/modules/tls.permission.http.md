tls.permission.http determines permission for a TLS certificate by making a request to an HTTP endpoint.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.permission.http#endpoint)endpoint
The endpoint to access. It should be a full URL. A query string parameter "domain" will be added to it, containing the domain (or IP) for the desired certificate, like so: `?domain=example.com`. Generally, this endpoint is not exposed publicly to avoid a minor information leak (which domains are serviced by your application).

The endpoint must return a 200 OK status if a certificate is allowed; anything else will cause it to be denied. Redirects are not followed.
