A set of authentication providers implementing the UserPasswordAuthenticator interface. If none are specified, all requests will always be unauthenticated.

ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.

Fulfilled by modules in namespace: **ssh.authentication.providers.password**
