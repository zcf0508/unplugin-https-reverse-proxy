http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a provides upstreams from A/AAAA lookups. Results are cached and refreshed at the configured refresh interval.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#name)name
The domain name to look up.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#port)port
The port to use with the upstreams. Default: 80

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#refresh)refresh
The interval at which to refresh the A lookup. Results are cached between lookups. Default: 1m

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#resolver)resolver
Configures the DNS resolver used to resolve the domain name to A records.

UpstreamResolver holds the set of addresses of DNS resolvers of upstream addresses

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#resolver/addresses)resolver/addresses
The addresses of DNS resolvers to use when looking up the addresses of proxy upstreams. It accepts [network addresses](https://caddyserver.com/docs/conventions#network-addresses) with port range of only 1. If the host is an IP address, it will be dialed directly to resolve the upstream server. If the host is not an IP address, the addresses are resolved using the [name resolution convention](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution) of the Go standard library. If the array contains more than 1 resolver address, one is chosen at random.

If Resolver is configured, how long to wait before timing out trying to connect to the DNS server.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

If Resolver is configured, how long to wait before spawning an RFC 6555 Fast Fallback connection. A negative value disables this.

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`Âµs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.a#versions)versions
The IP versions to resolve for. By default, both "ipv4" and "ipv6" will be enabled, which correspond to A and AAAA records respectively.
