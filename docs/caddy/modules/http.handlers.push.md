Description[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#docs "Direct link")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.push is a middleware for HTTP/2 server push. Note that HTTP/2 server push has been deprecated by some clients and its use is discouraged unless you can accurately predict which resources actually need to be pushed to the client; it can be difficult to know what the client already has cached. Pushing unnecessary resources results in worse performance. Consider using HTTP 103 Early Hints instead.

This handler supports pushing from Link headers; in other words, if the eventual response has Link headers, this handler will push the resources indicated by those headers, even without specifying any resources in its config.

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#resources)resources
The resources to push.

Resource represents a request for a resource to push.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#resources/method)resources/method
Method is the request method, which must be GET or HEAD. Default is GET.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#resources/target)resources/target
Target is the path to the resource being pushed.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers)headers
Headers to modify for the push requests.

HeaderConfig configures headers for synthetic push requests.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/add)headers/add
Adds HTTP headers; does not replace any existing header fields.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/set)headers/set
Sets HTTP headers; replaces existing header fields.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/delete)headers/delete
Names of HTTP header fields to delete. Basic wildcards are supported:

*   Start with `*` for all field names with the given suffix;
*   End with `*` for all field names with the given prefix;
*   Start and end with `*` for all field names containing a substring.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/replace)headers/replace
Performs in-situ substring replacements of HTTP headers. Keys are the field names on which to perform the associated replacements. If the field name is `*`, the replacements are performed on all header fields.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/replace/search)headers/replace/search
The substring to search for.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/replace/search_regexp)headers/replace/search_regexp

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.push#headers/replace/replace)headers/replace/replace
The string with which to replace matches.
