http.handlers.geofence implements IP geofencing functionality. [https://github.com/circa10a/caddy-geofence](https://github.com/circa10a/caddy-geofence)

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#ipbase_api_token)ipbase_api_token
ipbase_api_token is REQUIRED and is an API token ipbase.com. Free tier includes 150 requests per month.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#remote_ip)remote_ip
remote_ip is the IP address to geofence against. Not specifying this field results in geofencing the public address of the machine caddy is running on.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#allowlist)allowlist
allowlist is a list of IP addresses that will not be checked for proximity and will be allowed to access the server.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#status_code)status_code
status_code is the HTTP response code that is returned if IP address is not within proximity. Default is 403.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#cache_ttl)cache_ttl
cache_ttl is string parameter for caching ip addresses with their allowed/not allowed state. Not specifying a TTL sets no expiration on cached items and will live until restart. Valid time units are "ms", "s", "m", "h". In-memory cache is used if redis is not enabled.

A Duration represents the elapsed time between two instants as an int64 nanosecond count. The representation limits the largest representable duration to approximately 290 years.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#radius)radius
radius is the distance of the geofence in kilometers. If not supplied, will default to 0.0 kilometers. 1.0 => 1.0 kilometers.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#allow_private_ip_addresses)allow_private_ip_addresses
allow_private_ip_addresses is a boolean for whether or not to allow private ip ranges such as 192.X, 172.X, 10.X, [::1] (localhost). Default is false. Some cellular networks doing NATing with 172.X addresses, in which case, you may not want to allow.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#redis_enabled)redis_enabled
redis_enabled uses redis for caching. Default is false.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#redis_username)redis_username
redis_username is the username to connect to a redis instance. Default is "".

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.geofence#redis_password)redis_password
