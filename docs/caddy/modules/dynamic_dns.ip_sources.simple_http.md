dynamic_dns.ip_sources.simple_http is an IP source that looks up the public IP addresses by making HTTP(S) requests to the specified endpoints; it will try each endpoint with IPv4 and IPv6 until at least one returns a valid value. It is OK if an endpoint doesn't support both IP versions; returning a single valid IP address is sufficient.

The endpoints must return HTTP status 200 and the response body must contain only the IP address in plain text.
