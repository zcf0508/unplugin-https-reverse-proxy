Description[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#docs "Direct link")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

events.handlers.exec implements an event handler that runs a command/program. By default, commands are run in the background so as to not block the Caddy goroutine.

Field List
----------

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#command)command
The command to execute.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#args)args
Arguments to the command. Placeholders are expanded in arguments, so use caution to not introduce any security vulnerabilities with the command.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#dir)dir
The directory in which to run the command.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#timeout)timeout
How long to wait for the command to terminate before forcefully closing it. Default: 30s

Duration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/`µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#foreground)foreground
If true, runs the command in the foreground, which will block and wait for output. Only do this if you know the command will finish quickly! Required if you want to abort the event.

[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/events.handlers.exec#abort_codes)abort_codes
If the command exits with any of these codes, the event will be signaled to abort with the error. Must be running in the foreground to apply.

Fulfilled by modules in namespace:

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
