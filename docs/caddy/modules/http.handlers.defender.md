-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.defender implements an HTTP middleware that enforces IP-based rules to protect your site from AIs/Scrapers. It allows blocking or manipulating requests based on client IP addresses using CIDR ranges or predefined ranges for services such as AWS, GCP, OpenAI, and GitHub Copilot.

**JSON Configuration:**

```json
{
      "handler": "defender",
      "raw_responder": "block",
      "ranges": ["openai", "10.0.0.0/8"],
      "message": "Custom block message" // Only for 'custom' responder
    }
```

**Caddyfile Syntax:**

```
defender <responder_type> {
        ranges <cidr_or_predefined...>
        message <custom_message>
    }
```

Supported responder types:

*   `block`: Immediately block requests with 403 Forbidden
*   `custom`: Return a custom message (requires `message` field)
*   `drop`: Drops the connection
*   `garbage`: Respond with random garbage data
*   `redirect`: Redirect requests to a URL with 308 permanent redirect
*   `tarpit`: Stream data at a slow, but configurable rate to stall bots and pollute AI training.

For a list of predefined ranges, see the the [readme] [readme]: [https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/caddy-defender#embedded-ip-ranges](https://github.com/JasonLovesDoggo/caddy-defender#embedded-ip-ranges)
