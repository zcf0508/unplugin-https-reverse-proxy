http.matchers.host matches requests by the Host value (case-insensitive).

When used in a top-level HTTP route, [qualifying domain names](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#hostname-requirements) may trigger [automatic HTTPS](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https), which automatically provisions and renews certificates for you. Before doing this, you should ensure that DNS records for these domains are properly configured, especially A/AAAA pointed at your server.

Automatic HTTPS can be [customized or disabled](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http#servers/automatic_https).

Wildcards (`*`) may be used to represent exactly one label of the hostname, in accordance with RFC 1034 (because host matchers are also used for automatic HTTPS which influences TLS certificates). Thus, a host of `*` matches hosts like `localhost` or `internal` but not `example.com`. To catch all hosts, omit the host matcher entirely.

The wildcard can be useful for matching all subdomains, for example: `*.example.com` matches `foo.example.com` but not `foo.bar.example.com`.

Duplicate entries will return an error.
