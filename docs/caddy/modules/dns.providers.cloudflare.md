[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/dns.providers.cloudflare#api_token)api_token
API token is used for authentication. Make sure to use a scoped API **token**, NOT a global API **key**. It will need two permissions: Zone-Zone-Read and Zone-DNS-Edit, unless you are only using `GetRecords()`, in which case the second can be changed to Read.
