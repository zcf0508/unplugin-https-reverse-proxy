--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

layer4.handlers.tee is a layer4 handler that replicates a connection so that a branch of handlers can concurrently handle it. Reads happen in lock-step with all concurrent branches so as to avoid buffering: if one of the branches (including the main handler chain) stops reading from the connection, it will block all branches.

Handlers is the list of handlers that constitute this concurrent branch. Any handlers that do connection matching (which involves recording and rewinding the stream) are unsafe to tee, so do all connection matching before teeing.
