caddy.logging.encoders.append can be used to add fields to all log entries that pass through it. It is a wrapper around another encoder, which it uses to actually encode the log entries. It is most useful for adding information about the Caddy instance that is producing the log entries, possibly via an environment variable.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.logging.encoders.append#wrap)wrap
The underlying encoder that actually encodes the log entries. If not specified, defaults to "json", unless the output is a terminal, in which case it defaults to "console".

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.logging.encoders.append#fields)fields
A map of field names to their values. The values can be global placeholders (e.g. env vars), or constants. Note that the encoder does not run as part of an HTTP request context, so request placeholders are not available.
