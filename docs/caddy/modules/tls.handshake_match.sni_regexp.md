tls.handshake_match.sni_regexp matches based on SNI using a regular expression.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.handshake_match.sni_regexp#name)name
A unique name for this regular expression. Optional, but useful to prevent overwriting captures from other regexp matchers.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/tls.handshake_match.sni_regexp#pattern)pattern
The regular expression to evaluate, in RE2 syntax, which is the same general syntax used by Go, Perl, and Python. For details, see [Go's regexp package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/). Captures are accessible via placeholders. Unnamed capture groups are exposed as their numeric, 1-based index, while named capture groups are available by the capture group name.
