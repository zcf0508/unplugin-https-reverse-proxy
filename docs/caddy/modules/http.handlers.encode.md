Description[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#docs "Direct link")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.handlers.encode is a middleware which can encode responses.

Field List
----------

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#encodings)encodings
Selection of compression algorithms to choose from. The best one will be chosen based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.

ModuleMap is a map that can contain multiple modules, where the map key is the module's name. (The namespace is usually read from an associated field's struct tag.) Because the module's name is given as the key in a module map, the name does not have to be given in the json.RawMessage.

Fulfilled by modules in namespace: **http.encoders**

*   [gzip](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.encoders.gzip)
*   [zstd](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.encoders.zstd)
*   [br](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.encoders.br)Non-standard
*   [br](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.encoders.br)Non-standard

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#prefer)prefer
If the client has no strong preference, choose these encodings in order.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#minimum_length)minimum_length
Only encode responses that are at least this many bytes long.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#match)match
Only encode responses that match against this ResponseMmatcher. The default is a collection of text-based Content-Type headers.

ResponseMatcher is a type which can determine if an HTTP response matches some criteria.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#match/status_code)match/status_code
If set, one of these status codes would be required. A one-digit status can be used to represent all codes in that class (e.g. 3 for all 3xx codes).

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.encode#match/headers)match/headers
If set, each header specified must be one of the specified values, with the same logic used by the [request header matcher](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/http/servers/routes/match/header/).

Fulfilled by modules in namespace:

This property is **required** because it specifies the module name.
