-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

http.reverse_proxy.upstreams.multi is a single dynamic upstream source that aggregates the results of multiple dynamic upstream sources. All configured sources will be queried in order, with their results appended to the end of the list. Errors returned from individual sources will be logged and the next source will continue to be invoked.

This module makes it easy to implement redundant cluster failovers, especially in conjunction with the `first` load balancing policy: if the first source returns an error or no upstreams, the second source's upstreams will be used naturally.
