http.matchers.cron matches requests based on multiple sets of cron expressions. It allows you to define multiple time windows during which requests should be matched. The matcher becomes active after any of the time windows specified by EnableAt and inactive after any corresponding DisableAt.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.cron#enable_at)enable_at
EnableAt is a slice of cron expressions specifying when the matcher should start matching. Each entry in the slice corresponds to a matching time window.

[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.matchers.cron#disable_at)disable_at
DisableAt is a slice of cron expressions specifying when the matcher should stop matching. Each entry in the slice must correspond to an entry in EnableAt.
