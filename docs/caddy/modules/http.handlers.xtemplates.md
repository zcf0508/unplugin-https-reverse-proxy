ModuleID is a string that uniquely identifies a Caddy module. A module ID is lightly structured. It consists of dot-separated labels which form a simple hierarchy from left to right. The last label is the module name, and the labels before that constitute the namespace (or scope).

Thus, a module ID has the form: .

An ID with no dot has the empty namespace, which is appropriate for app modules (these are "top-level" modules that Caddy core loads and runs).

Module IDs should be lowercase and use underscores (_) instead of spaces.

Examples of valid IDs:

*   http
*   http.handlers.file_server
*   caddy.logging.encoders.json
