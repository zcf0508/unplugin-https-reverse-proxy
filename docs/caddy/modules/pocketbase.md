Description[ðŸ”—](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/pocketbase#docs "Direct link")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

pocketbase is a Caddy module that provides an embedded PocketBase server.

The module provides admin API endpoints under `/pocketbase/`:

*   `POST /pocketbase/superuser` - Create a new superuser
*   `PUT /pocketbase/superuser` - Upsert a superuser
*   `PATCH /pocketbase/superuser` - Update superuser password
*   `DELETE /pocketbase/superuser` - Delete a superuser
*   `POST /pocketbase/superuser/{email}/otp` - Generate OTP for superuser

All the above endpoints require a JSON payload, except for the OTP endpoint. The JSON payload for the superuser endpoints is as follows:

```
{
    "email_address": "...",
    "password": "..."
}
```

The `DELETE` endpoint does not expect the `password` field.

Although PocketBase prints a URL in the logs to create the first superuser, the host part of the URL is not correct. You can either replace the host part with the host defined in your Caddy configuration, or use the admin API endpoint to create the first superuser.

The app can be configured in the Caddyfile through the `pocketbase` block in the global options section. Syntax:

```
pocketbase {
    data_dir <path>
    listen   <addr>
    origins  <origin...>
}
```

If the block is omitted, the default values are used.

Field List
