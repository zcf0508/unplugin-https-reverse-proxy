tls.ca_pool.source.lazy defers the generation of the certificate pool from the guest module to demand-time rather than at provisionig time. The gain of the lazy load adds a risk of failure to load the certificates at demand time because the validation that's typically done at provisioning is deferred. The validation can be enforced to run before runtime by setting `EagerValidation`/`eager_validation` to `true`. It is the operator's responsibility to ensure the resources are available if `EagerValidation`/`eager_validation` is set to `true`. The module also incurs performance cost at every demand.

Whether the validation step should try to load and provision the guest module to validate the correctness of the configuration. Depeneding on the type of the guest module, the resources may not be available at validation time. It is the operator's responsibility to ensure the resources are available if `EagerValidation`/`eager_validation` is set to `true`.
